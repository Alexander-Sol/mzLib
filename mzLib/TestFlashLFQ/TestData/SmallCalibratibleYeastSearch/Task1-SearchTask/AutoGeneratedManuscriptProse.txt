The data analysis was performed using MetaMorpheus version 1.1.0, available at https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus.

The following search settings were used: Protease = trypsin; search for truncated proteins and proteolysis products = False; maximum missed cleavages = 2; minimum peptide length = 7; maximum peptide length = unspecified; initiator methionine behavior = Variable; 
fixed modifications = Carbamidomethyl on C, Carbamidomethyl on U; variable modifications = Oxidation on M; max mods per peptide = 2; max modification isoforms = 1024; precursor mass tolerance = ±5.0000 PPM; product mass tolerance = ±20.0000 PPM; report PSM ambiguity = True. The combined search database contained 6060 non-decoy protein entries including 0 contaminant sequences. Data files were processed on a computer running Microsoft Windows 10.0.22631 with a 64-bit Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214R CPU @ 2.40GHz processor with 24 threads and 256GB installed RAM. 

The total time to perform the Search task on 1 spectra file(s) was 0.10 minutes.
